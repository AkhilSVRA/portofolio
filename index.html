            <h3>JAVA-Based Rock-Paper-Scissors Game</h3>
            <p id="project1" class="project-content">I developed a Rock Paper Scissors game in Java, where users can play against the computer in a console-based environment. The game features simple user input handling, random number generation for the computer's moves, and logic to determine the winner based on traditional rules. It includes input validation to ensure smooth gameplay and allows users to replay multiple rounds in the same session. This project helped me strengthen my understanding of Java, particularly in the areas of conditional statements, loops, and user interaction.</p>

            <h3>Medical Robot</h3>
            <p id="project2" class="project-content">In my B.Tech, I developed a major project focused on creating a medical robot designed to assist healthcare environments. The robot was equipped with the capability to serve tablets to patients and monitor their activities through a network of sensors, significantly reducing the need for direct social interactions between patients and healthcare staff. Utilizing Wi-Fi for real-time data transmission, the system aimed to improve patient care efficiency while maintaining safety protocols, especially in environments requiring minimal physical contact.</p>

            <h3>Web Designing</h3>
            <p id="project3" class="project-content">I have also developed several web pages, including login pages and resumes. These projects helped me gain practical experience in front-end web development, working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create responsive and user-friendly interfaces. Through these web pages, I focused on designing clean layouts, validating user inputs, and enhancing the user experience across different platforms and devices.</p>
